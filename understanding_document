start with git hub 
1) create repository from git hub without selecting any check box
2) then run the commands as given on the same page to initialize 
eg- $ git init
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M master
git remote add origin https://github.com/vampireayushi/blah1.git
git push -u origin masterInitialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/Ayushi/Desktop/git_learning/.git/

3) run the above commands in git bash (select the folder which you want to initialize by right click and open git bash)
4) run command ls -la to view all files , you ll see .git file which means you have created a new repository.
5) now you can create one document in local(i.e document in the folder which has been initialised)
6) in git bash type git status- to see untracking files(files which are not staged)
7) git add filename (this add the file in staging area)
8) git status ( now filename is in green in color which means file is added to stage).
9) git commit -m meassage1
10) git push origin master ( this will add file to git repository in git hub to branch master)
